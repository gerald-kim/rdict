    <h2><a name="Setup" id="Setup"></a> Setup <small><small><a href=
    "#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    <p>When you first load Vocabulator, you'll go through a quick setup
    process. If you are able to view this help page, then you've
    already successfully installed Vocabulator and downloaded the
    database file. So we can skip over that part here. Let's start by
    describing the basic idea behind Vocabulator.</p>
    <h2><a name="The_Basic_Idea" id="The_Basic_Idea"></a> The Basic
    Idea <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    <p>"A new word is like a fresh seed sown on the ground of the
    discussion."<br/>
    - Wittgenstein (Culture and Value, 1980)<br/></p>
    <p>Words are the building blocks of language, and one's vocabulary
    is an important resource for communication and self-expression. The
    program you've downloaded, called Vocabulator, aims to help you
    expand your vocabulary, in an easy and efficient way.</p>
    <p>To help you expand your vocabulary, Vocabulator makes use of two
    components: a Dictionary, and Flashcard Quizzes. The dictionary
    allows you to look up the definitions of new words you come across
    conveniently. The flashcard quizzes give you an effective way to
    practice the words you look up.</p>
    <p>Studying with Vocabulator works in three steps. When you
    encounter a word you don't know, you</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Look up the word in the dictionary,</li>
      <li>Browse the dictionary page and tell Vocabulator which
      definition(s) you want help with remembering, and</li>
      <li>Do flashcard quizzes prepared by Vocabulator to remember the
      words you look up.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The rest of this help file describes each of the three steps
    above in more detail.</p>
    <h2><a name="The_Four_Tabs" id="The_Four_Tabs"></a> Vocabulator's
    Four Tabs <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    In Vocabulator, there are four main tabs with which you should
    become familiar. A picture of the tabs appears below.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="tabs.png" alt=""></p>
    Each tab gives you access to different features:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Search Tab:</span> This is
      where you search for and look up words. In this tab, you can also
      choose definitions to get help with remembering.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Review Tab:</span> This is
      where you do your daily vocabulary review. This screen allows you
      to start flashcard quizzes; you can also view statistics on your
      flashcard collection and on your study performance.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The History Tab:</span> The
      History tab provides you with easy access to past dictionary
      searches.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The More Tab:</span> In
      addition to the Help file you are viewing now, the More tab allows
      you to view licensing information, manage your flashcard
      collection, and adjust default settings.</li>
    </ul>
    In the next three sections, we describe each tab in more
    detail.<br/>
    <h2><a name="The_Search_Tab" id="The_Search_Tab"></a> The Search
    Tab <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    When Vocabulator finishes loading, it always displays the screen
    for the Search tab first.
        
    <h3><a name="Searching" id="Searching"></a> Searching
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    Looking up a word on the Search screen is simple: touch the search
    box and begin typing your word. You can type the whole word, or
    type the first few letters and then br/owse to your word by
    scrolling down the list.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="searching.png" alt=""></p>
    If your word doesn't appear in the list, that means Vocabulator
    doesn't have a definition for that word. 
    <h3><a name="Viewing_Definitions" id=
           "Viewing_Definitions"></a>Viewing Definitions
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    To choose a word, simply touch it, and Vocabulator will display the
    dictionary page for the word.<br/>
    <br/>
    Dictionary pages in Vocabulator are a slightly modified version of
    Wiktionary's online web pages and look like the picture below.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="search_results.png" alt=""></p>
    The word you looked up appears in the title; below the title are
    the word's etymology and definitions. A separate definition exists
    for the noun, verb and other grammar categories. Synonyms are often
    provided. In some cases, examples are provided too.<br/>
    <h3><a name="Shortcuts" id="Shortcuts"></a> Shortcuts
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    You may have noticed in the pictures above that certain words on a
    dictionary page appear in blue. Blue words are a convenient
    shortcut: simply touch them and Vocabulator will show you the
    definition for the word. No typing required.<br/>
    <h3><a name="Backwards_and_Forwards_Navigation" id=
           "Backwards_and_Forwards_Navigation"></a> Backwards and Forwards
    Navigation <small><small><a href=
    "#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    At times, you may want to compare the definitions of two words, or
    simply review a definition you looked up previously, after using a
    shortcut. For your convenience, dictionary pages in Vocabulator
    have 'Backwards' and 'Forwards' arrows at the top of the screen.
    These arrows are just like the buttons on your web br/owser.
    <h3><a name="The_Star_Button" id="The_Star_Button"></a> The Star
    Button <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    You've probably already noticed the star buttons  on the dictionary page. Their purpose is as
    follows: if, after looking up a word, you decide that this is a
    word you'd like help with remembering, use the star button.

    To use the star button, review the definitions in the dictionary
    page, and press the star beside the definition you would like to
    remember. When you press the star button, Vocabulator creates a new
    flashcard for the word, using the definition you selected, and adds
    it to your card collection. After you press the star button,
    Vocabulator shows you a br/ief message to confirm that the
    definition was added.
    
    So far, we've talked about the dictionary part of Vocabulator. In
    the next section, we describe how Vocabulator uses the flashcard
    collection you build with the dictionary and star buttons to help
    you to remember the words you look up.<br/>
    <h2><a name="The_Review_Tab" id="The_Review_Tab"></a> The Review
    Tab <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    On the Review Tab screen, you exercise your vocabulary skills by
    doing Flashcard Quizzes. Vocabulator quizzes you on the words
    you've selected for review with the star button. Let's look at
    reviewing in more detail.
    <h3><a name="Review_Home_Screen" id="Review_Home_Screen"></a>The
    Review Home Screen <small><small><a href=
    "#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    Pressing the review tab br/ings you to the Review Home screen. The
    Review Home screen has two sections: the Review Exercises section
    (the top half of the screen), and the Study Statistics section (the
    bottom half).
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src=
                                  "todays_scheduled_and_review_tab.png" alt=""></p>
    Here's a description:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Review Exercises
      Section</span>: From this area, you can start Flashcard Quizzes. On
      the left, you will see a br/ief description of the quiz. On the
      right, there is a 'Go!' button you can press to start an
      exercise.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Study Statistics
      Section</span>: This area gives you information about your
      flashcard collection, and tells how well you know the cards in your
      collection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll begin with the Review Exercises first.</p>
    <h3><a name="Review_Exercises" id="Review_Exercises"></a> Review
    Exercises <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    In Vocabulator, there are two types of review exercises: Scheduled
    Practice and Early Practice.<br/>
    <h4>Scheduled Practice</h4>
    As you look up more words, your flashcard collection grows. After
    some time, it becomes impractical to practice all the cards in your
    collection; you only have time to review a limited number of cards
    each day. How to choose cards for review?<br/>
    <br/>
    To solve this problem, Vocabulator automatically chooses cards for
    you using a technique called <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced
    Repetition</a>. In spaced repetition, cards are chosen based on how
    easy it is for you to remember the word and when you are likely to
    forget the definition.<br/>
    <br/>
    When you use a star button to create a flashcard, Vocabulator
    schedules a practice time for you to view that card. The first
    practice time is usually the day after you pressed the star button
    (i.e. tomorrow).<br/>
    <br/>
    Future practice times depend on how easy or hard it is for you to
    recall the definition of the word on the card. Difficult cards are
    scheduled for review in the near future; easier cards are scheduled
    for review farther in the future. And, as cards become easier, they
    are scheduled farther into the future.<br/>
    <br/>
    Scheduled Practice quizzes are the main way of using Vocabulator
    and, when they are available, appear in the Review Exercise area
    like so:<br/>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img alt="" src=
                                  "todays_scheduled_label.png"></p>
    <h4>Early Practice</h4>
    <p>In addition to Scheduled Practice, there is another type of
    review exercise called Early Practice. In this exercise, you
    practice the cards that you have selected for review with the star
    button today. Early practice quizzes appear like so:</p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img alt="" src=
                                  "early_practice_message.png"></p>
    <h4>No Available Quizzes</h4>
    When there are no cards scheduled for today, or if you have not
    selected any words for review today, then the Review Exercises will
    show a message like the following:
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="no_review_exercises_label.png"
                                  alt=""></p>
    Next, let's look at how a flashcard quiz actually works.
    <h3><a name="Flashcard_Quizzes" id=
           "Flashcard_Quizzes"></a>Flashcard Quizzes <small><small><a href=
           "#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    Flashcard Quizzes in Vocabulator are straightforward. When you
    click the 'Go!' button to start a quiz, Vocabulator loads a
    practice set of cards and shows you each card, one at a time.<br/>
    <br/>
    First, you'll see the front of the card. The front will have a word
    on it, like in the example below.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="flashcard_front.png" alt=""></p>
    By showing you the front of a card, Vocabulator is challenging you
    to remember the definition. Try to remember it. Once you've
    remembered the definition (or realized you've forgotten it), press
    'Show Answer'. This will flip the card over to the other side,
    revealing the definition of the word (see below).
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="flashcard_back.png" alt=""></p>
    Did you remember the definition correctly? Was it easy? Or did you
    forget? Vocabulator wants to know! Tell Vocabulator how easy or
    hard it was for you to remember the definition by using one of the
    four buttons that appear below the card. <br/>
    <br/>
    After you press one of the buttons, Vocabulator will show you the
    next card to review. When you finish the last card, Vocabulator
    returns you to the Review Home screen.<br/>
    <h3><a name="Study_Statistics" id="Study_Statistics"></a> Study
    Statistics <small><small><a href=
    "#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    Sometimes it's nice to see the progress you're making in your
    studies. In Vocabulator, we've tried to give you some feedback on
    your studying by showing you a couple of simple statistics that we
    think might be useful.<br/>
    <br/>
    The first statistic is about your flashcard collection. On the
    left, you can view the total number of cards you have in your
    collection. On the right, a line graph shows you how the size of
    your card collection has changed over the past 30 days.<br/>
    <br/>
    The second statistic is a score representing how well you know the
    cards in your collection. The score is a percentage, with 100%
    being the maximum score and 0% the minimum. Today's value for the
    score appears on the left, and a second line graph appears on the
    right, showing you how your score has changed over the past 30
    days.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img alt="" src=
                                  "study_statistics.png"></p>
    Vocabulator calculates your score in the following way. First, it
    calculates each card's score: this is the average of the difficulty
    you reported for the card on the last quiz three attempts. Second,
    it calculates the overall score, which is just the average of the
    card scores for each card in your collection. So, to achieve 100 %,
    you have to be able to easily recall all the words in your
    flashcard collection three times in a row.
    <h3><a name="Summary_" id="Summary_"></a>Summary <a href=
    "#top"><small>top</small></a></h3>
    And that's it for reviewing! Use Vocabulator once a day and check
    the Review tab to see if there are cards scheduled for today. If
    so, practice the words with a flashcard quiz. Check the card
    statistics to watch your progress in learning the words you look up
    with the dictionary.<br/>
    <h2><a name="Other_Tabs" id="Other_Tabs"></a> Other Tabs
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h2>
    The Search and Review tabs in Vocabulator are the main tabs where
    you'll do most of your work, but there are others. We've included a
    History tab and a More tab to make using Vocabulator more
    convenient and useful.
    <h3><a name="The_History_Tab" id="The_History_Tab"></a>The History
    Tab <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    <p>There may be times when you would like quick access to words
    you've looked up in the past. For example, you may wish to view the
    full definition of a word, and not only the smaller section
    included on a flashcard.</p>
    <p>To make looking up past words more convenient, we've included a
    History tab which gives you easy access to past searches.</p>
    <p>Each word you look up is shown in a list, organized by date.
    Words looked up on the same day appear in the order they were
    looked up. Here's a picture!</p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="history.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>To view the full definition for a word, scroll through the list
    untill you find the word and then touch the row. Vocabulator will
    load the full dictionary page, which is identical to the page you
    viewed in the Search tab.</p>
    <h3><a name="The_More_Tab" id="The_More_Tab"></a> The More Tab
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h3>
    <p>The More tab is where we've put features that might come in
    handy every now and then, but that you probably won't be using as
    often as the Search, Review and History features.</p>
    <p>In addition to this help file you are viewing now, the More tab
    gives you access to 3 other features in Vocabulator.<br/></p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="more_tab.png" alt=""></p>
    <h4><a name="about" id="about"></a>About <a href=
    "#top"><small>top</small></a></h4>
    <p>Ok, so this isn't really a feature, but the About screen does
    provide you with contact information, the Vocabulator version
    number and licenses for Vocabulator, the Wiktionary data we use and
    for third party software components used during development.</p>
    <h4><a name="Manage" id="Manage"></a> Managing Your Cards
    <small><small><a href="#top">top</a></small></small></h4>
    We've included a Manage screen to allow you to make changes to your
    flashcard collection. From this screen you can Add cards, or Edit
    and Delete cards in your collection. Pressing the Manage button
    launches the Card Manager screen, which looks like the following:
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="manage_cards_list.png" alt=
                                  ""></p>
    Editing and Deleting cards is accomplished in two steps.<br/>
    <br/>
    First, br/owse to the card you want to Edit or Delete by scrolling
    through the card list until you see the card you're after. If your
    collection is very big, or you prefer typing, you can use the text
    box at the top to filter the cards in the list. Type the first few
    letters of the word to speed up your search, just like in the
    searching part of the Search tab.<br/>
    <br/>
    Stop scrolling when you see the card you want, and press the button
    to the right of the card to go to the Edit screen. The Edit Screen
    should look something like the screen below.
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="edit_or_delete.png" alt=""></p>
    Second, use the edit screen to make your changes:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit the definition and press 'Save' to save your changes.</li>
      <li>If you want to delete the card from your collection, use the
      Delete button.</li>
      <li>Cancel your changes with the Cancel button.</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, if you'd like to create a new card for a word that isn't
    included in Vocabulator, use the New Card button located at the top
    of the screen, to the right of the search box. On the Add screen,
    enter the word and definition to create a card and add it to your
    collection.<br/>
    <h4><a name="Settings" id="Settings"></a> Settings <a href=
    "#top"><small>top</small></a></h4>
    At present, we're not sure which features of Vocabulator will need
    to be adjusted. This section will be updated as the setting screen
    becomes finalized. Possible features might include:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear your search history</li>
      <li>Reset the system. You can reset your grade. You can also reset
      the card easiness.</li>
      <li>Download an updated dictionary.</li>
      <li>Change the maximum amount of cards you are able to view per
      day.</li>
    </ul>
