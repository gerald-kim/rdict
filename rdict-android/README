The Android version of RDict needs to have the word databases placed in the 'asset' folder.

Because of the ~ 1 megabyte size limit on a file, we have to chop-up a dictionary.  
Use the script make_small_db_cdb.py to create the dictionary files for Android.  
The script should output a number of files called 
word0.db, word1.db, ... in pywiktionary/enwiktionary-small_cdb.  
Simply copy those files to rdict-android/assets and then RDict should be ready to go.
** This is a bit of a hack right now.  I'm sure it can be done better**

To run, use Eclipse's Run configuration.  Easy as that!

Note: Android emulator is really slow... It takes a long time to appear 
and for the app to load (at least on my computer)

Note: to run the test cases, first right-click and Run as 'JUnit' test.  On the next dialog,
click the checkbox for 'Override Project Settings', then select 'Run as AndroidUnitTest'.
If you do this, the test should work.

Note: to see what the Emulator is doing and to view output from System.out, use 
Window > Show View > Other > Android > LogCat

Note: Best way to test the app repeatedly is just to leave Emulator running.  Eclipse will start
the app automatically on the emulator for you.  It's kind of nice.
