The Android version of RDict needs to have the word databases placed in the 'asset' folder.

Note: Android emulator is really slow... It takes a long time to appear 
and for the app to load (at least on my computer)

Note: to run the test cases, first right-click and Run as 'JUnit' test.  On the next dialog,
click the checkbox for 'Override Project Settings', then select 'Run as AndroidUnitTest'.
If you do this, the test should work.

Note: to see what the Emulator is doing and to view output from System.out, use 
Window > Show View > Other > Android > LogCat

Note: Best way to test the app repeatedly is just to leave Emulator running.  Eclipse will start
the app automatically on the emulator for you.  It's kind of nice.
