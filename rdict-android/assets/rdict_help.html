<p>New to RDict?</p>

<p>
If you're new to RDict and want to get an idea of how it works, read on.  Here, we'll give you a quick tour of how RDict can be used to look up the definitions of words, and maintain and improve your vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to download the app from the Apple store.  Because we're going to focus on how RDict works, we'll skip that part here.  If you need information on how to download RDict to your iPhone or iPod Touch, please visit this page.
</p>

<p>
When you start RDict for the first time, you'll see the Dictionary screen, shown in the picture below.
</p>

<p>
Looking up a word on the Dictionary screen is simple: when you touch the search box, a keyboard will pop up.  Type in your word, and when you're finished, press the 'Search' button.
</p>

<p>
If there's an exact match, RDict will show you the definition for the word you entered; if not, RDict will show you a list of words similar to the one you entered.  To choose a word, simply touch it, and RDict will display the dictionary page for the word.
</p>

<p>
Dictionary pages in RDict look like the picture shown below.  The word you looked up appears first, followed by additional information.  The structure of the entry resembles the structure in the Wiktionary web page.  A separate entry exists for the noun, verb or other parts of speech.  Synonyms are often provided.  In some cases, examples are provided too.
</p>

<p>
In the dictionary page for a word, some words will appear in blue.  Blue words are a convenient shortcut: simply touch them and RDict will show you the entry for the word.  No typing required.
</p>

<p>
You'll notice that right now we don't have a pronunciation audio file for your listening.  Don't worry, we're working hard on this and it should be available soon in a free update for customers who've already purchased RDict.
</p>

<p>
At times, you may want to compare the definitions of two words, or simply review a definition you looked up previously.  For your convenience, RDict has 'Backwards' and 'Forwards' arrows at the top of the screen.  These arrows are just like the buttons on your web browser: touching the 'Backwards' arrow shows you the entry for the word you looked up previously.  The 'Forwards' arrow allows you to move forward to more recent searches again in your history.
</p>

<p>
So far, we've talked about the dictionary part of RDict.  Next, we describe how RDict helps you to remember the words you look up.
</p>

<p>
You've probably already noticed the 'Remember' buttons on the dictionary screen (shown above).  Their purpose is pretty simple.  If, after looking up a word, you decide that this is a word you'd like help with remembering, press the 'Remember' button.  When you press the button, RDict creates a flashcard for the word in memory, which you review later.  Flashcards look like the following:
</p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In addition to creating a flashcard, RDict also schedules a practice time for you to view the card.  The first practice time is usually the same day you press the remember button.  Future practice times depend on how easy or hard it is for you to recall the definition of the word on the card.
</p>

<p>
Studying with RDict is done in 'Review Sessions'.  Review sessions typically works as follows.  First, take a look at the iPhone home screen below.
</p>

<p>

<p>
See the little '12' number at the top right corner of the RDict icon?  That number is showing you that there are 12 cards scheduled to be practised today.  The number is updated each day, according to how many cards are scheduled for practice.  You can practice any time of the day: morning, afternoon or evening.  And, if you're busy, RDict will automatically reschedule your cards to make sure that you have a manageable amount.
</p>

<p>
To practise in a review session, start RDict by touching the icon.
</p>

<p>
After RDict launches, you can start the review mode by tapping the review icon on the tab bar: it's the one on the bottom right side of the screen.  Pressing this button brings you to the Review Home screen.  The Review Home screen shows you the number of cards scheduled for review today, and approximately how long your review session will take.  There's also a button for managing your stack of cards, but we'll explain that a bit later.  
</p>

<p>
If you click 'Start', a practice session will start up.
</p>

<p>
Practising with RDict is pretty straightforward.  When you click 'Start', RDict loads the scheduled cards into memory, and shows you the flashcards, one at a time.  First, you'll see the front of the card.  The front will have a word on it, as shown in the example below.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
By showing you the front of a card, RDict is challenging you to remember the definition.  Once you've remembered the definition (or realized you've forgotten it), press 'View Answer'.  This will flip the card over to the other side, which appears as follows:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
When you click 'View Answer', RDict flips the flashcard over, revealing the definition of the word you've been quizzed on.  Did you remember the definition correctly?  Was it easy? Or did you forget?
RDict want's to know!  Tell RDict how easy or hard it was for you to remember the definition, using one of the four buttons that appears on the bottom of the card.  For example, if you've totally forgotten the word, press the 'I forget' button.  After you press one of the buttons, RDict will show you the next scheduled.
</p>

<p>
And that's it!  You practice a set of flashcards daily to remember the definitions of the word you look up with the dictionary.  As mentioned, RDict schedules harder words for earlier and more frequent practice, and the scheduling algorithm makes sure that you don't have an unmanageable amount of cards to practice in a single day.
</p>

<p>
Practice on the bus, subway or on the plane.  Or, squeeze in a quick practice session before you go to bed.  We hope you find reviewing with RDict convenient.  We'd love to hear how well it works for you, or take suggestions for future improvements.
