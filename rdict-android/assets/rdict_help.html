<h1> RDict - Help</h1>
<h2> New to RDict? </h2>
<p> If you are new to RDict and want to get an idea of how it works,
read on.&nbsp; We'll give you a quick tour of how RDict can be used to
look up the definitions of words, and to help maintain and improve your
vocabulary.</p>
<h2> Setup
</h2>
<p>Before RDict can be used, you have to do a quick setup process.
&nbsp;If you are able to view this help page, then you've already
successfully installed RDict and downloaded the database file. &nbsp;So
we can skip over that part here. &nbsp;Let's start by&nbsp;describing
the basic idea behind RDict.</p>
<h2> The Basic Idea </h2>
<p> Everybody would benefit from a better vocabulary. &nbsp;RDict aims
to make learning new words more convenient, and help you remember the
new words you come across. &nbsp;To do so, RDict makes use of two main
components: a Dictionary and&nbsp;Flashcard Quizzes. &nbsp;The
dictionary allows you to look up the definitions of new words you come
across conveniently. &nbsp;The flashcard quizzes give you an
effective&nbsp;way to practice the words you look up. </p>
<p> Studying with RDict works in three steps. &nbsp;When you encounter
a word you don't know, you </p>
<ol>
  <li> Look up the word in the dictionary. </li>
  <li> Browse the dictionary page and tell RDict which definition you
want help with remembering. </li>
  <li> Do flashcard quizzes prepared by RDict to remember the words you
look up. </li>
</ol>
<p> ** a diagram showing the above process here**
</p>
<p> The rest of this help file describes each of the three steps above
in more detail.</p>
<h2> The Four Tabs
</h2>
When setup finishes, RDict&nbsp;shows you&nbsp;four tabs at the bottom
of the screen. &nbsp;Each tab gives you access to different features:<br>
<ul>
  <li> The Search Tab: This is where you search for and look up
words.&nbsp; In this tab, you can also choose definitions to get help
with remembering. </li>
  <li>The Review Tab: This is where you do your daily vocabulary
review.&nbsp; This screen allows you to start flashcard
quizzes.&nbsp; You can also view&nbsp;statistics on your flashcards and
on your study performance. </li>
  <li>The History Tab:&nbsp; The History tab provides you with easy
access to
past dictionary searches. </li>
  <li>The More Tab: In addition to the Help file you are viewing now,
the
More tab also allows you to view licensing
information, manage your flashcard stack, and adjust default settings. </li>
</ul>
In the next three sections, we describe each tab in more detail.
<br>
<h2> The Search Tab
</h2>
After Setup, you will see the Search screen. &nbsp;The Search screen is
the dictionary part of RDict where you can look
up the definition of words; this screen is also the place where you
tell RDict which words you want help remembering.
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>When&nbsp;RDict first loads, it always displays the Search tab
first. &nbsp;The picture below shows the Search screen just after
Setup.
</p>
<p> *dic screen pic*
</p>
<h3> Searching
</h3>
Looking up a word on the Search screen is simple:&nbsp;touch the search
box and begin typing your word.&nbsp; You can
type the whole word, or type the first few letters and then browse to
your word by scrolling down the list.
<br>
<p> *middle of a search pic*
</p>
If your word doesn't appear in the list, that means RDict doesn't have
a definition for that word.
<h3> Viewing Definitions
</h3>
To choose a word, simply touch it, and RDict will display the
dictionary page for the word.<br>
<br>
Dictionary pages in
RDict look like the picture shown below. &nbsp;They are a slightly
modified version of the online Wiktionary pages.
<br>
<p> *dictionary page sample*
</p>
The word you looked up appears first, followed by its etymology,
definitions, and other information. The structure of
the entry resembles the structure in the original Wiktionary web page.
A separate entry exists for the noun, verb or
other parts of speech. Synonyms are often provided. In some cases,
examples are provided too.
<br>
<h3> Shortcuts
</h3>
In the dictionary page for a word, some words will appear in blue. Blue
words are a convenient shortcut: simply touch
them and RDict will show you the definition for the word. &nbsp;No
typing required.
<br>
<h3>Backwards and Forwards Navigation
</h3>
At times, you may want to compare the definitions of two words, or
simply review a definition you looked up previously, after using a
shortcut.
&nbsp;For your convenience, dictionary pages in RDict&nbsp;have
'Backwards' and 'Forwards' arrows at the top of the screen.
&nbsp;These arrows are just like the buttons on your web browser.
<br>
<h3> Asking RDict for help with remembering a definition
</h3>
You've probably already noticed the star&nbsp;buttons on the dictionary
screen (** icon here**). Their purpose is as
follows: if, after looking up a word, you decide that this is a word
you'd like help with remembering, use&nbsp;the star
button.
<br>
<br>
To use the star button, review the definitions in the dictionary page,
and press the star beside the definition you
would like to remember. &nbsp;When you press the star button, RDict
creates a new flashcard for the word and adds it to
your card collection. &nbsp;After you press the star button, RDict
shows you a brief message to confirm that the
definition was added.
<br>
<br>
** picture of card being added
<br>
<br>
So far, we've talked about the dictionary part of RDict. &nbsp;In this
section, we describe how RDict uses the flashcard
collection you build with the dictionary and star button to help you to
remember the words you look up.
<br>
<h2> The Review Tab
</h2>
In RDict, you maintain and improve your vocabulary by doing Flashcard
Quizzes. &nbsp;RDict quizzes you on the words you've selected
for review with the star button. &nbsp;Let's look at reviewing in more
detail.
<h3> Review Home Screen
</h3>
Pressing the review tab brings you to the Review Home screen. The
Review Home screen has two main sections: the Exercise
section (the top half of the screen), and the Study Statistics section
(the bottom half).
<br>
<br>
** picture here**<br>
<br>
Here's a description:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Review Exercise Section: From this area,&nbsp;you can start
Flashcard Quizzes. &nbsp;On the left, you will see a brief description
of the quiz. &nbsp;On the right, there is a 'Go!' button&nbsp;you can
press to start an exercise. </li>
  <li>Study Statistics Section: This area gives you information about
your
Flashcard Collection and how well you remember the cards in your
collection.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll begin with the Review Exercises first.
</p>
<h3> Review Exercises
</h3>
RDict provides two&nbsp;review exercises: Today's Scheduled
Flashcards&nbsp;and Words Looked up Today.
<br>
<h4> Today's Scheduled Flashcards
</h4>
Scheduled cards is the main way of using RDict. &nbsp;As you lookup
more words, your flashcard collection grows.
&nbsp;After some time, it becomes impractical to practice all the cards
in your collection; you only have time to review a limited number of
cards.
<br>
<br>
How to choose&nbsp;cards for review? &nbsp;One way might be to do
choose cards from your collection randomly. &nbsp;Another way might be
to select cards most
recently added to your stack. &nbsp;A better way might be
to&nbsp;chooses cards based on how easy it is for you to
remember the word and when you are likely to forget the definition;
this is how RDict works.
<br>
<br>
When you use a star button to create a flashcard, RDict&nbsp;schedules
a practice time for you to view that card. The
first practice time is usually the same day you press the star button.
&nbsp;Future practice times depend on how easy or hard
it is for you to recall the definition of the word on the card.
&nbsp;Difficult cards are scheduled for review in the
near future; easier cards are scheduled for review farther in the
future. &nbsp;And, as cards become easier, they are scheduled
farther into the future. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
In the Today's Scheduled Flashcards quiz, &nbsp;you practice cards that
are scheduled for today.<br>
<br>
Sometimes there
are cards scheduled for today, and sometimes not. &nbsp;It's easy to
find out if there are. &nbsp;Take a look at the
screenshot of the tab bar shown below.
<br>
<p> *screen pic*
</p>
See the little '12' number on the 'Review' tab?&nbsp; That number is
telling you that there are 12 cards scheduled for
practice today.&nbsp; The number is updated each day, according to how
many cards are scheduled for practice. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
There is also another type of review exercise called Looked up Today.
&nbsp;In this exercise, you practice the cards that you have selected
for review with the star button today. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
When there are no cards scheduled for today, or if you have not
selected any words for review today, then the Review Exercises will
show a message like the following:<br>
<br>
** picture here **<br>
<br>
Next, let's look at how a flashcard quiz actually works.
<h3> Flashcard Quizzes
</h3>
Flashcard Quizzes in RDict are&nbsp;straightforward. When you click the
'Go!' button to start a quiz, RDict loads today's scheduled
cards and shows you each&nbsp;card, one at a time.<br>
<br>
First, you'll see the front of the card. The front will have a word
on it, like in the example below.
<br>
<br>
*front of flashcard pic*
<br>
<br>
By showing you the front of a card, RDict is challenging you to
remember the definition. Try to remember it. &nbsp;Once you've
remembered the
definition (or realized you've forgotten it), press 'View Answer'. This
will flip the card over to the other side, revealing the definition of
the word (shown below).
<br>
<br>
*back of flashcard pic*
<br>
<br>
Did you remember the definition correctly? Was it easy? Or did you
forget? RDict wants to know! Tell RDict how easy
or hard it was for you to remember the definition by using one of the
five buttons that appear on the bottom of the card.
For example, if you have totally forgotten the definition, press the 'I
forget' button.<br>
<br>
After you press one of the
buttons, RDict will show you the next&nbsp;card to review. &nbsp;When
you&nbsp;finish the last card, RDict returns you to the Review Home
screen.
<br>
<h3> Study Statistics Description
</h3>
Sometimes it's nice to know how well your studying is going. &nbsp;In
RDict, we've tried to give you some feedback on your studying by
showing you a couple of simple
statistics that we think might be useful for you when you study.
<br>
<br>
The first statistic is about your flashcard collection. &nbsp;In text,
we show you how many cards you have in your
stack, and how many cards you have added today. &nbsp;Next to the text,
we have a line graph;&nbsp;the line graph shows
you how your total number of cards has grown over the past 30 days.
<br>
<br>
The second statistic is a score representing how well you know the
cards in your collection. &nbsp;The score is a
percentage, with 100% being the maximum score and 0% the minimum. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
RDict calculates your score in the following
way. &nbsp;First, it calculates the average of each individual word
score over the last three quizzes. &nbsp;We call this the
card score. &nbsp;The overall score is the average card score, for all
the cards in your collection. &nbsp;To get the maximum, score, you have
to be able to easily recall all the words in your flashcard collection
three consecutive times. &nbsp;Next to the
text, we have a second line graph which shows you how your score has
changed over the past 30 days.
<h3> Summary
</h3>
And that's it for reviewing! &nbsp;Use RDict once a day and check the
Review tab to see if there are cards scheduled for today.
&nbsp;If so, practice the words with a flashcard quiz. &nbsp;Check the
card statistics to watch your progress in
learning the words you look up with the dictionary.
<br>
<h2> Other Tabs</h2>
The Search and Review tabs in RDict are the main tabs where you'll do
most of your work, but there are others. &nbsp;Weve included a History
tab and a More tab to make using RDict more convenient and useful.
<h3> The History Tab
</h3>
<p>There may be times when you would like quick access to words you've
looked up in the past. &nbsp;For example, you may wish to view the full
definition of a word, and not only the smaller section included on a
flashcard.</p>
<p>To make looking up past words more convenient, we've included a
History tab which gives you easy access to past searches.</p>
<p>Each word you look up is shown in a list, organized by date.
&nbsp;Words looked up no the same day appear in the order they were
looked up. &nbsp;Here's a picture!</p>
<p>*History tab*</p>
<p>To view the full definition for a word, scroll through the list
untill you find the word and then touch the row. &nbsp;RDict will load
the full dictionary page, which is identical to the page
you&nbsp;viewed in the Search tab.</p>
<h3>The More Tab
</h3>
<p>The more tab is where we've put features that might come in handy
every now and then, but that you probably won't be using as often as
the Search, Review and History features.</p>
<p>In addition to this help file you are viewing now, the More tab
gives you access to 3 other features in RDict. <br>
</p>
<h4> About
</h4>
<p>Ok, so this isn't really a feature, and many eople might never look
at it, but the About screen does provide you with information on the
RDict version number and license, as well as the license for the
WIktionary data we use and for the third party software components used
to develop RDict.</p>
<h4>Manage
</h4>
We've included a Manage screen to allow you to control your flashcard
collection. &nbsp;Like the description located to the left of the
button says, from this screen you can Add cards, or Edit and Delete
cards in your collection. &nbsp;Pressing the Manage button launches the
Card Manager screen, which looks like the following:<br>
<br>
* care manager screen*<br>
<br>
Editing and Deleting cards is accomplished in two steps.<br>
<br>
First, browse to the card you want to Edit or Delete by scrolling
through the card list until you see the card you're after. &nbsp;If
your collection is very big, or you prefer typing, you can use the text
box at the top to filter the cards in the list. &nbsp;Type the first
few letters of the word to speed up your search, just like in the
searching part of the Search tab.<br>
<br>
Stop scrolling when you see the card you want, and press the button to
the right of the card to go to the Edit screen.<br>
<br>
The Edit Screen should resemble something like the screen below.<br>
<br>
* picture of card edit screen here*<br>
<br>
Using the Edit screen is straightforward: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Edit the definition and press&nbsp;'Save' to save your changes.</li>
  <li>If you want to delete the card from your collection, use the
Delete button.</li>
  <li>Cancel your changes with the Cancel button.</li>
</ul>
Finally, if you'd like to create a new card for a word that isn't
included in RDict, use the New Card button located&nbsp;to the right of
the text box at the top. &nbsp;On the Add screen, enter the word and
definition to create a card and add it to your collection.<br>
<h4>Settings
</h4>
At present, we're not sure which features of RDict will need to be
adjusted. &nbsp;This section will be updated as the setting screen
becomes finalized. &nbsp;Possible features might include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Clear your search history</li>
  <li>Reset the system. &nbsp;You can reset your grade. &nbsp;You can
also
reset the card easiness.
  </li>
  <li>Re-download the dictionary.
  </li>
  <li>Change the maximum amount of cards you are able to view per day.
  </li>
</ul>
