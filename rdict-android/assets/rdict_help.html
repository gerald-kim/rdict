<h2> <a name="Setup"> </a>
Setup <small> <small>
<a href="#top">top </a> </small>
</small></h2>
<p> Before RDict can be used, you
have to do a quick setup process.
&nbsp;If you are able to view this help page, then you've already
successfully installed RDict and downloaded the database file.
&nbsp;So
we can skip over that part here. &nbsp;Let's start
by&nbsp;describing
the basic idea behind RDict.
</p>
<h2> <a name="The_Basic_Idea"> </a>
The Basic Idea <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h2>
<p>"One forgets words as one forgets names.&nbsp; One's vocabulary
needs constant fertilizing or it will die."<br>
- Evelyn Waugh (English writer, 1903-1966)<br>
</p>
<p>Words are the building blocks of language, and one's vocabulary is
an important resource for communication and self-expression.&nbsp; The
program you've downloaded, called RDict, aims to help you expand your
vocabulary, in an easy and efficient way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you expand your vocabulary, RDict makes
use
of two components: a Dictionary, and&nbsp;Flashcard Quizzes.
&nbsp;The dictionary allows you to look up the definitions of new
words
you come across conveniently. &nbsp;The flashcard quizzes give you
an
effective&nbsp;way to practice the words you look up.
</p>
<p> Studying with RDict works in
three steps. &nbsp;When you encounter
a word you don't know, you
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Look up the word in the
dictionary, </li>
  <li>Browse the dictionary page
and tell RDict which definition(s) you want
help with remembering, and </li>
  <li>Do flashcard quizzes
prepared by RDict to remember the words you look
up. </li>
</ol>
<p> The rest of this help file
describes each of the three steps above
in more detail.
</p>
<h2> <a name="The_Four_Tabs"> </a>
RDict's Four Tabs <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h2>
In RDict, there are four main tabs with which you should become
familiar. &nbsp;A picture of the tabs appears below.
<p class="centeredImage"><img src="file:///android_asset/tabs.png"
 alt=""></p>
Each tab gives you access to different features:
<br>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Search Tab:</span>
This is
where you search for and look up words.&nbsp; In this tab, you can
also
choose definitions to get help with remembering. </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Review Tab:</span>
This is
where you do your daily vocabulary review.&nbsp; This screen allows
you
to start flashcard
quizzes; you can also view&nbsp;statistics on your
flashcard
collection and on your study performance. </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The History Tab:</span>&nbsp;
The
History tab provides you with easy access to past dictionary searches. </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The More Tab:</span>
In addition
to the Help file you are viewing now, the More tab allows you to
view licensing
information, manage your flashcard stack, and adjust default settings. </li>
</ul>
In the next three sections, we describe each tab in more detail.
<br>
<h2> <a name="The_Search_Tab"> </a>
The Search Tab <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h2>
When&nbsp;RDict finishes loading, it always displays the
screen for the Search tab
first. &nbsp;The picture below shows the Search screen just after
startup.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/after_setup.png" alt=""></p>
<h3> <a name="Searching"> </a>
Searching <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
Looking up a word on the Search screen is simple:&nbsp;touch the
search
box and begin typing your word.&nbsp; You can
type the whole word, or type the first few letters and then browse to
your word by scrolling down the list.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/searching.png" alt=""></p>
If your word doesn't appear in the list, that means RDict doesn't have
a definition for that word (send us an <a
 href="mailto:support@ampliostudios.com">email</a>
to let us know and we'd be happy to include it).
<h3> <a name="Viewing_Definitions"> </a>Viewing Definitions <small>
<small> <a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
To choose a word, simply touch it, and RDict will display the
dictionary page for the word.
<br>
<br>
Dictionary pages in RDict are a slightly modified version
of&nbsp;Wiktionary's online web pages and&nbsp; look like the picture
below.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/search_results.png" alt=""></p>
The word you looked up appears in the title; &nbsp;below the title are
the
word's&nbsp;etymology and&nbsp;definitions. &nbsp;A separate definition
exists for the noun, verb and other grammar categories. &nbsp;Synonyms
are often provided. In some cases,
examples are provided too.
<br>
<h3> <a name="Shortcuts"> </a>
Shortcuts <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
You may have noticed in the pictures above that certain words on a
dictionary page appear in blue. &nbsp;Blue
words are a convenient shortcut: simply touch
them and RDict will show you the definition for the word. &nbsp;No
typing required.
<br>
<h3>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img src="file:///android_asset/shortcut.png"
 alt=""></p>
</h3>
<h3> <a name="Backwards_and_Forwards_Navigation"> </a>
Backwards and
Forwards Navigation <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small></small></h3>
At times, you may want to compare the definitions of two words, or
simply review a definition you looked up previously,
after using a shortcut. &nbsp;For your convenience, dictionary
pages in
RDict&nbsp;have 'Backwards' and 'Forwards'
arrows at the top of the screen. &nbsp;These arrows are just like
the
buttons on your web browser.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img alt="Backwards and Forwards Navigation"
 src="file:///android_asset/backwards_in_search.png"></p>
<h3> <a name="The_Star_Button"> </a>
The Star Button <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
You've probably already noticed the star&nbsp;buttons (<img
 src="file:///android_asset/star_off.png" alt="">) on the
dictionary page.
Their purpose is as follows: if, after looking up a word, you decide
that this is a word you'd like help with
remembering, use&nbsp;the star button.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/star_highlight.png" alt=""></p>
To use the star button, review the definitions in the dictionary page,
and press the star beside the definition you
would like to remember. &nbsp;When you press the star button, RDict
creates a new flashcard for the word, using the definition you
selected, and adds it to
your card collection. &nbsp;After you press the star button, RDict
shows you a brief message to confirm that the
definition was added.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/card_added.png" alt=""></p>
So far, we've talked about the dictionary part of RDict. &nbsp;In
the next
section, we describe how RDict uses the flashcard
collection you build with the dictionary and star buttons to help you
to
remember the words you look up.
<br>
<h2> <a name="The_Review_Tab"> </a>
The Review Tab <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h2>
On the Review Tab screen, you exercise your
vocabulary skills by doing Flashcard
Quizzes. &nbsp;RDict quizzes you on the words
you've selected for review with the star button. &nbsp;Let's look
at
reviewing in more detail.
<h3> <a name="Review_Home_Screen"> </a>The Review Home Screen <small>
<small> <a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
Pressing the review tab brings you to the Review Home screen. The
Review Home screen has two&nbsp;sections: the Review Exercises
section (the top half of the screen), and the Study Statistics section
(the bottom half).
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/todays_scheduled_and_review_tab.png" alt=""></p>
Here's a description:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Review Exercises
Section</span>: From this
area,&nbsp;you can start
Flashcard Quizzes. &nbsp;On the left, you will see a brief
description
of the quiz. &nbsp;On the right, there is a 'Go!'
button&nbsp;you can
press to start an exercise. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Study Statistics
Section</span>: This area gives you
information about your flashcard collection, and tells how well you
know the
cards in your collection.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p> We'll begin with the Review
Exercises first.
</p>
<h3> <a name="Review_Exercises"> </a>
Review Exercises <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
In RDict, there are two types of&nbsp;review exercises:&nbsp;Scheduled
Practice and Early Practice.
<br>
<h4>Scheduled Practice
</h4>
As you
look up
more words, your flashcard collection grows.
&nbsp;After some time, it becomes impractical to practice all the
cards
in your collection; you only have time to review
a limited number of cards each day. How to choose&nbsp;cards for review?<br>
<br>
To solve this problem, RDict automatically chooses cards for you using
a technique called <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a>.
&nbsp;In spaced repetition, cards are chosen based on how easy it is
for you to remember
the
word and when you are likely to forget the
definition.<br>
<br>
When you use a star button to create a flashcard,
RDict&nbsp;schedules
a practice time for you to view that card. The
first practice time is usually the day after you pressed the star
button (i.e. tomorrow).<br>
<br>
Future practice times depend on how easy or
hard it is for you to recall the definition of the word on the card.
&nbsp;Difficult cards are scheduled for review in
the near future; easier cards are scheduled for review farther in the
future. &nbsp;And, as cards become easier, they
are scheduled farther into the future. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Scheduled Practice quizzes are the main way of using RDict and, when
they are available,&nbsp;appear in the Review Exercise area like so:
<br>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img alt=""
 src="file:///android_asset/todays_scheduled_label.png"></p>
To know whether or not a scheduled practice quiz is available, you can
look at the tab bar. &nbsp;Take a
look at the screenshot of the tab bar shown below.
<br>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/review_tab_closeup.png" alt="">
</p>
See the little '12' number on the 'Review' tab?&nbsp; That number
is
telling you that there are 12 cards scheduled for
practice today.&nbsp; The number is updated each day, according to
how
many cards are scheduled for practice.
<br>
<h4>Early Practice</h4>
<p>In addition to Scheduled Practice, there is another type
of&nbsp;review exercise called Early Practice.
&nbsp;In this exercise, you practice the cards
that you have selected for review with the star button today.
&nbsp;Early practice quizzes appear like so:
</p>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img alt=""
 src="file:///android_asset/early_practice_message.png"></p>
<h4>No Available Quizzes</h4>
When there are no cards scheduled for today, or if you have not
selected any words for review today, then the Review
Exercises will show a message like the following:
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/no_review_exercises_label.png" alt=""></p>
Next, let's look at how a flashcard quiz actually works.
<h3> <a name="Flashcard_Quizzes"> </a>Flashcard Quizzes <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
Flashcard Quizzes in RDict are&nbsp;straightforward. When you click
the
'Go!' button to start a quiz, RDict loads a practice set of cards and
shows you each&nbsp;card, one at a
time.
<br>
<br>
First, you'll see the front of the card. The front will have a word on
it, like in the example below.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/flashcard_front.png" alt=""></p>
By showing you the front of a card, RDict is challenging you to
remember the definition. Try to remember it. &nbsp;Once
you've remembered the definition (or realized you've forgotten it),
press 'View Answer'. This will flip the card over to
the other side, revealing the definition of the word (see below).
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/flashcard_back.png" alt=""></p>
Did you remember the definition correctly? Was it easy? Or did you
forget? RDict wants to know! Tell RDict how easy or
hard it was for you to remember the definition by using one of the four
buttons that appear below the card.
For example, if you have totally forgotten the definition, press the 'I
forgot' button.
<br>
<br>
After you press one of the buttons, RDict will show you the
next&nbsp;card to review. &nbsp;When you&nbsp;finish the
last card, RDict returns you to the Review Home screen.
<br>
<h3> <a name="Study_Statistics"> </a>
Study Statistics <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
Sometimes it's nice to see the progress you're making in your studies.
&nbsp;In
RDict, we've tried to give you some feedback on
your studying by showing you a couple of simple statistics that we
think might be useful.
<br>
<br>
The first statistic is about your flashcard collection. &nbsp;In
text,
we show you the total number of cards you have in your
collection. &nbsp;Next to the
text,
we have a line graph;&nbsp;the line graph shows
you how your total number of cards has changed over the past 30 days.
<br>
<br>
The second statistic is a score representing how well you know the
cards in your collection. &nbsp;The score is a
percentage, with 100% being the maximum score and 0% the minimum.
&nbsp;
<p class="centeredImage"> <img alt=""
 src="file:///android_asset/study_statistics.png"></p>
RDict calculates your score in the following way. &nbsp;First, it
calculates the average of each individual word score
over the last three quizzes. &nbsp;We call this the card score.
&nbsp;The overall score is the average card score, over
all the cards in your collection. &nbsp;To achieve the maximum score,
you
have to be able to easily recall all the words in
your flashcard collection three consecutive times. &nbsp;Next to
the
text, we have a second line graph which shows you
how your score has changed over the past 30 days.
<h3> <a name="Summary_"> </a>Summary <a href="#top"> <small>
top </small>
</a></h3>
And that's it for reviewing! &nbsp;Use RDict once a day and check
the
Review tab to see if there are cards scheduled for
today. &nbsp;If so, practice the words with a flashcard quiz.
&nbsp;Check the card statistics to watch your progress in
learning the words you look up with the dictionary.
<br>
<h2> <a name="Other_Tabs"> </a>
Other Tabs <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h2>
The Search and Review tabs in RDict are the main tabs where you'll do
most of your work, but there are others.
&nbsp;Weve included a History tab and a More tab to make using
RDict
more convenient and useful.
<h3> <a name="The_History_Tab"> </a>The History Tab <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
<p> There may be times when you
would like quick access to words you've
looked up in the past. &nbsp;For example, you may wish to view the
full
definition of a word, and not only the smaller section included on a
flashcard.
</p>
<p> To make looking up past words
more convenient, we've included a
History tab which gives you easy access to past searches.
</p>
<p> Each word you look up is shown
in a list, organized by date.
&nbsp;Words looked up&nbsp;on the same day appear in the order they
were
looked up. &nbsp;Here's a picture!
</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img src="file:///android_asset/history.jpg"
 alt="">
</p>
<p></p>
<p> To view the full definition
for a word, scroll through the list
untill you find the word and then touch the row. &nbsp;RDict will
load
the full dictionary page, which is identical to the page
you&nbsp;viewed in the Search tab.
</p>
<h3> <a name="The_More_Tab"> </a>
The More Tab <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h3>
<p> The More tab is where we've
put features that might come in handy
every now and then, but that you probably won't be using as often as
the Search, Review and History features.
</p>
<p> In addition to this help file
you are viewing now, the More tab
gives you access to 3 other features in RDict. <br>
</p>
<p class="centeredImage"> <img src="file:///android_asset/more_tab.png"
 alt="">
</p>
<p></p>
<h4> <a name="about"> </a>
About <a href="#top"> <small>
top </small>
</a></h4>
<p> Ok, so this isn't really a
feature, but the About screen does provide you with contact
information,&nbsp;the
RDict version number and licenses for RDict, the
Wiktionary data we use and for&nbsp;third party software components
used during development.
</p>
<h4> <a name="Manage"> </a>
Managing Your Cards <small> <small>
<a href="#top"> top </a>
</small> </small></h4>
We've included a Manage screen to allow you to control your flashcard
collection. From this screen you can Add cards, or
Edit and Delete cards in your collection.
&nbsp;Pressing the Manage button launches the Card Manager screen,
which looks like the following:
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/manage_cards_list.png" alt=""></p>
Editing and Deleting cards is accomplished in two steps.
<br>
<br>
First, browse to the card you want to Edit or Delete by scrolling
through the card list until you see the card you're
after. &nbsp;If your collection is very big, or you prefer typing,
you
can use the text box at the top to filter the
cards in the list. &nbsp;Type the first few letters of the word to
speed up your search, just like in the searching part
of the Search tab.
<br>
<br>
Stop scrolling when you see the card you want, and press the button to
the right of the card to go to the Edit screen.
<br>
<br>
The Edit Screen should look something like the screen below.
<p class="centeredImage"> <img
 src="file:///android_asset/edit_or_delete.png" alt=""></p>
Using the Edit screen is straightforward:
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Edit the definition and
press&nbsp;'Save' to save your changes. </li>
  <li>If you want to delete the
card from your collection, use the Delete
button. </li>
  <li>Cancel your changes with the
Cancel button. </li>
</ul>
Finally, if you'd like to create a new card for a word that isn't
included in RDict, use the New Card button
located at the top of the screen, to the right of the search box.
&nbsp;On
the Add
screen, enter the word and definition to create a
card and add it to your collection.
<br>
<h4> <a name="Settings"> </a>
Settings <a href="#top"> <small>
top </small>
</a></h4>
At present, we're not sure which features of RDict will need to be
adjusted. &nbsp;This section will be updated as the
setting screen becomes finalized. &nbsp;Possible features might
include:
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Clear your search history </li>
  <li>Reset the system.
&nbsp;You can reset your grade. &nbsp;You can also
reset the card easiness. </li>
  <li>Download an updated
dictionary. </li>
  <li>Change the maximum amount of
cards you are able to view per day. </li>
</ul>
